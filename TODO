TODO
- trash `this.title`
- trash assigning this.el? that should happen in ampersand-view
- in constructor, detect formContainer Element or string hook
    - in render, use ref as set above.
    - update README about hook in formContainer
    - update README `template` about `data-hook=form-container` reference, as it can be overridden
        - scratch that, simply trash `template`, but make notes about it above
